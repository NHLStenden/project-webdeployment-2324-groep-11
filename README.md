### **MySQL Server Within Docker**

To spin up the SQL server and execute the SQL query provided along within this repo, just go to the "Docker" directory within the repository.

- Open up up the CMD within the same directory.

- Run the following command `docker-compose up -d`

This will start up the SQL server, create the tables within the server and finally populate it with some dummy data.

The `-d` flag is for the container to run in the background
